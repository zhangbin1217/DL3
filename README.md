## Preparation
This repository supports PyTorch 1.0, python 2.7, 3.6, and 3.7.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Demo
### Supervised Classification/Clustering with only pairwise similarity
```bash
# A quick trial:
python demo.py  # Default Dataset:MNIST, Network:LeNet, Loss:MCL
python demo.py --loss KCL

# Lookup available options:
python demo.py -h

# For more examples:
./scripts/exp_supervised_MCL_vs_KCL.sh
```
### Unsupervised Clustering (Cross-task Transfer Learning)
```bash
# Learn the Similarity Prediction Network (SPN) with Omniglot_background and then transfer to the 20 alphabets in Omniglot_evaluation.
# Default loss is MCL with an unknown number of clusters (Set a large cluster number, i.e., k=100)
# It takes about half an hour to finish.
python demo_omniglot_transfer.py

# An example of using KCL and set k=gt_#cluster
python demo_omniglot_transfer.py --loss KCL --num_cluster -1

# Lookup available options:
python demo_omniglot_transfer.py -h

# Other examples:
./scripts/exp_unsupervised_transfer_Omniglot.sh
```
